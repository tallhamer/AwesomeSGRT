=======================================
Surface Guided Radiation Therapy (SGRT) is a rapidly growing technique that uses stereo vision technology to track
patientsâ€™ surface in 3D, for both setup and motion management during radiotherapy. Surface Guided Radiation Therapy can
be used for many types of radiation therapy. There are numerous publications that support its use in the treatment of
breast, brain, head and neck cancer, sarcoma, and other conditions.
